Discussion: For both the programs, I implemented a way to have recursive function that creates the same shape on each side of the base shape. Originally I had no idea how to approach this project until in class I had a look at Professor Grinberg's example code and saw what he did. And it gave me the idea on how to attack the project. It took a lot of trial and error to get the coordinates correctly but eventually I got it. My original actually took me longer just because I couldn't get the correct functions down for the coordinates. This project was fun but time consuming.

Analysis: The Sierpinski program and my original recursion program's memory depend on how many recursions it does. If the depth is 3, it will stay on the same stack even if there is only 1, 2, or 3 (sierpinski) triangles.

Time invested: about 15~ hours
